Practicing JavaScript fundamentals

## LeetCode Practice

### Fizz Buzz
- Solved my first LeetCode problem.
- Focused on loop control and conditional order.
- Learned why checking divisibility by both 3 and 5 first is important.

## Progress
- Continued JavaScript fundamentals practice.
- Revised variables, data types, and operators.
- Reinforced conditional logic through simple examples.
- Practiced if/else conditions and comparison operators.
- Learned the difference between == and ===.
- Practiced loops combined with conditional logic.
- Practiced basic array creation and iteration.
- Practiced basic array methods like push(), pop(), and using length.
- Practiced JavaScript functions that process and return array values.
- Practiced filtering arrays using loops and conditional logic.
- Practiced filtering arrays using JavaScript array.filter().
- Practiced transforming arrays using JavaScript array.map().
- Practiced summarizing arrays using JavaScript array.reduce().
- Combined filter, map, and reduce for end-to-end data processing.
- Practiced JavaScript arrow functions with array methods.
- Understand this keyword vs arrow functions. Arrow functions do NOT bind this. They inherit this from their surrounding scope.
